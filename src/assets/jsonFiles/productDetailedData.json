          "review_text": "Absolutely love this phone, bought as a replacement for my previous Motorola which managed to survive 7+ years of my best efforts to kill it.\n\nFirst off, it was easy to buy with a prompt delivery. Out of the box it was already 75% charged and just required a simple insertion of my nano SIM before switching on. A quick boot-up followed with some straightforward configuration options all completed in a matter of minutes before it was ready to go; I particularly liked the option of choosing a browser (I chose Brave amongst the many others). It's bigger than expected with a 6.5\" screen so doesn't fit as easily in my pocket as previous but on the plus side means a better view when watching videos or sport.\n\nInitial switch on is quick, shutting down quicker and general browsing and alternating between apps is quick, surprisingly quick at this pricepoint.\n\nThe camera takes some lovely pics, phone calls are clear including VOIP ones, weight is fine, \"feel\" of the phone is pleasant with buttons and on screen keyboard having positive feedback and action.\n\nAfter having charged the phone to full which didn't take long at all, 48 hours later it's still over 80% charged. Admittedly I don't use mobile data unless I have to (just wi-fi most of the time) so those permanently online might notice a quicker discharge - so far the battery life lives up to its claims.\n\nAn interesting point to note is that thought the specification states it's 4G only I made a call which connected on 3G as well which I'm not technical enough to understand but perhaps this phone does more than stated.\n\nAll-in-all I am very, very pleased and would recommend this to anyone requiring something easy to use at an economic price, lovely jubbly :)",
